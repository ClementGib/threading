A thread in Java is a lightweight process. Threads allow a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at once.
In Java, a thread can be created by implementing the Runnable interface or by extending the Thread class.
The Thread class itself provides methods like start(), run(), and sleep(). Creating a thread involves invoking the start() method,
which in turn calls the run() method where the actual work is defined.
Thread synchronization is important when multiple threads access shared resources.
