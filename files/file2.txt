Java's multithreading capability enables programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently.
Each thread in a Java program runs independently of others unless they share resources, in which case synchronization is necessary.
The Runnable interface in Java allows for defining a threadâ€™s tasks without extending the Thread class.
In this way, you can create a new thread while still inheriting from another class if needed.
Java also provides various thread states like NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, and TERMINATED.
